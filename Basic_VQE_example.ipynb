    "## Create Molecules\n",
    "The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm \"simulates\" molecules on a quantum level. This basically comes down to that it is able to find the \"ground state energy\" (the energy belonging to the lowest state it can be in) of the molecule. This is interesting because chemicals like to be in their lowest energy state.\n",
    "\n",
    "A VQE works by approximating the eigenvalues of a matrix. In quantum chemistry, the molecule is represented by a matrix called the Hamiltonian such that the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian correspond to the possible energy level of the molecule and the eigenvectors represent the molecular states. The lowest eigenvalue is the lowest energy state, which is the one we are trying to find.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to represent this molecule on a quantum computer, we need to agree on a method to turn electron states of the molecule to qubits. And ofcourse, there are multiple ways you can do this and they depend on your `basis_set` (analogous to 3D systems: what is up? Left-handed vs right-handed systems). Although there are many choices for the `basis_set`, `\"sto-3g\"` is the most commenly used one in VQE. The choice of `transformation` is a bit more controversial. There are multiple camps, but the 2 largest are `\"jordan-wigner\"` and `\"bravyi-kitaev\"`. Here is a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.02233.pdf) that compares the two with a more detailed explanation."

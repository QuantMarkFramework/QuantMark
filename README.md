# QuantMark

Welcome to the mother repository of the project. The project is about developing an _API for benchmarking quantum computing algorithms_.

__All the information__ such as the documentation and the links of the project can be found from [Wiki](https://github.com/quantum-ohtu/QuantMark/wiki).

See the application's current state at [staging](https://ohtup-staging.cs.helsinki.fi/qleader/).

The previous version that was made by the previous group [ohtu2021-kvantti](https://github.com/ohtu2021-kvantti) is also at staging [quantmark](https://ohtup-staging.cs.helsinki.fi/quantmark/).

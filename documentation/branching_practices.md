# Branching practices

- The main branch is always ready to production.
- If there is any changes to the code, those are first implemented to _develop branch_. When the changes are ready, then the develop branch is merged to the main branch.
  - If there is changes to the documentation or any changes that won't affect to the program, those can be committed straight to the main branch. 
- There isn't just one person responsible for merging. Instead, merging is taken in turns.

The current WebMark2_uml.png is generated with graph_models, a Django extension using the following command:
python manage.py graph_models -a --disable-abstract-fields -o WebMark2_uml.png

The command above requires the next packages to be installed through pip: graphviz, django-extensions and pydotplus.

You can filter the models drawn with the flag -I, for example "-I Result,Run*".

Instructions on how to install and use graph_models can be found behind the following links:
